# AI4R Explore Agent Practical Assignment

This repository contains the code for the AI for Autonomous Robotics practical on training a deep reinforcement learning agent for a 2D mobile robot exploration task.

The exercise uses a custom Gymnasium environment, Ray RLlib, PyTorch, and Pygame. The main task is a multi-room exploration challenge trained with PPO.

## Assignment Overview

The goal is to train a simulated mobile robot to explore a small multi-room map while avoiding walls. Each room contains checkpoint gates. The agent receives reward for crossing new checkpoints, and the episode has a fixed time budget.

A good policy should visit as many unique checkpoints as possible before the time limit. A poor policy may collide, spin near the start, or repeatedly revisit the same area.

Students should use the exercise to connect reinforcement learning concepts from the lectures to an implemented DRL workflow:

- reading the environment and agent code;
- understanding the action space, observation space, reward function, and training loop;
- training a DRL policy in the custom environment;
- testing the trained policy visually;
- changing selected hyperparameters and explaining their effect on exploration behavior.

The original assignment handout is included here:

- [AIAR_RL_practical_assignment_1-4-a.pdf](AIAR_RL_practical_assignment_1-4-a.pdf)

## Learning Objectives

After completing the practical, students should be able to:

- explain how a custom robot environment is represented using the Gymnasium API;
- describe how observations, actions, rewards, and episode termination are implemented in code;
- train and evaluate a DRL agent using Ray RLlib;
- interpret the effect of selected hyperparameters on reward curves and rollout behavior;
- present the final policy behavior using short videos, plots, or screenshots.

## Environment

The robot moves in a 2D continuous environment with walls, rooms, door openings, and checkpoint gates. The default `rooms` map has a side alcove, an upper internal room, and lower compartments connected by narrow openings. The room layout is scaled larger than the original racing-track exercise so the robot has clearer visual clearance from walls during inspection. The environment follows the standard Gymnasium interaction pattern:

- `reset()` initializes an episode;
- `step(action)` applies one action and returns the next observation, reward, and termination flags;
- `render()` visualizes the robot and map using Pygame.

The main environment implementation is:

```text
Exploring_agent_DRL/Explore-Agent/explore_agent/envs/exploring_gym.py
```

## Action Space

The agent controls the robot using two continuous actions:

```text
action = [propulsion, rotation]
```

- `propulsion > 0`: move forward;
- `propulsion < 0`: move backward;
- `rotation > 0`: rotate right;
- `rotation < 0`: rotate left.

Both action values are clipped to the range `[-1, 1]`.

## Observation Space

The observation vector contains range-like clearance measurements and robot motion/goal information:

```text
observation = [l1, ..., l7, v, alpha, beta]
```

where:

- `l1` to `l7` are clearance values measured at different angles around the robot;
- `v` is the robot speed magnitude;
- `alpha` is the angle between the robot heading and its velocity direction;
- `beta` is the angle between the robot heading and the next goal/checkpoint direction.

In the default `coverage` task, the observation is extended with five unvisited checkpoint slots. Each slot contains the relative angle, distance, and visibility flag for a reachable visible point sampled along one nearby unvisited checkpoint. The final two values report overall checkpoint progress and how long the robot has gone without collecting a new checkpoint. This is different from the older racing-track task, where one next checkpoint was enough. Sampling the checkpoint target keeps the policy from aiming at endpoints close to walls or already visited gates.

The observation values are normalized to match the declared Gymnasium observation space.

## Reward

The default task uses `reward_mode="coverage"`. Each checkpoint gives reward only the first time it is crossed or passed closely:

```text
+0.5 for each new checkpoint
 0.0 for revisiting an already collected checkpoint
hovering in explored space gives -0.004 per step
not approaching a visible unvisited checkpoint gives -0.002 per step
wall-contact penalty starts at -0.2 and converges to -0.5 cumulatively between checkpoints
```

The coverage task also adds penalties when the robot hovers in an already visited coarse map cell or fails to approach a visible unvisited checkpoint. If both conditions hold, the combined shaping penalty is `-0.006` per step, so it becomes visible during long 1000-step experiments without overpowering the `+0.5` checkpoint reward. Checkpoint collection uses a map-scaled hit radius and a wall visibility check, so the robot can collect a gate when it reaches it but should not collect or target gates through walls. Wall contact blocks the robot and adds a bounded escalating penalty, but it does not end the default rooms episode. The wall-contact penalty state resets after a new checkpoint is reached. This discourages standing still or repeatedly driving into walls, while the checkpoint count remains the main evaluation score.

The episode ends when the robot collects all checkpoints or reaches the step limit. The default `rooms` map has 20 checkpoints. Each checkpoint is worth `0.5`, so the checkpoint reward maximum is `10.0`. The training return can be lower if the robot hits walls or spends time hovering without exploring. The default challenge uses `max_steps=400`, which corresponds to about 20 seconds in the visual rollout with the default sleep value.

## Student Task

Train a DRL agent to maximize checkpoint coverage in the multi-room environment. PPO is provided as the default algorithm, but other off-the-shelf RLlib algorithms can also be tested.

Recommended experiments:

- train PPO on the `rooms` environment with `coverage` reward;
- vary one or two selected hyperparameters;
- compare reward curves, checkpoint coverage, and rollout behavior;
- test whether the trained policy enters multiple rooms;
- document failure cases such as collisions, oscillations, or getting stuck;
- keep the challenge map fixed for fair comparison.

The main PPO training script is:

```text
Exploring_agent_DRL/Explore_PPO_agent_training.py
```

The rollout script for testing a trained checkpoint is:

```text
Exploring_agent_DRL/explore_agent_rollout.py
```

## Deliverable

Prepare a short video or presentation segment showing:

- which DRL algorithm was used;
- which hyperparameters or environment settings were changed;
- training evidence such as reward curves or logs;
- visual rollout of the trained robot;
- how many checkpoints the robot reached within the time limit;
- examples of both successful and challenging test cases.

The assignment handout specifies a short video report rather than a written report.

```

Detailed Windows, Ubuntu/Linux, and macOS setup notes are provided in:

- [Exploring_agent_DRL/README.md](Exploring_agent_DRL/README.md)

## Quick Check

Run this after activating the Conda environment:

```bash
python -c "from explore_agent.envs.exploring_gym import ExploreDrone; env = ExploreDrone({'gui': False, 'env_name': 'rooms', 'reward_mode': 'coverage', 'max_steps': 5}); obs, _ = env.reset(); print('observation shape:', obs.shape); obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step([0.0, 0.0]); print(round(float(reward), 4), terminated, truncated, info)"
```

## Manual Driving

Use manual control first to inspect the map and robot behavior.

Windows:

```bat
python Explore-Agent\explore_agent\envs\start_human.py
```

Ubuntu/Linux/macOS:

```bash
python Explore-Agent/explore_agent/envs/start_human.py
```

Use the arrow keys to drive. Press `r` to reset.

## Train PPO

Short CPU run:

```bash
python Explore_PPO_agent_training.py --iterations 20 --num-workers 0 --num-gpus 0 --env-name rooms --reward-mode coverage --max-steps 400
```

Longer CPU run:

```bash
python Explore_PPO_agent_training.py --iterations 500 --num-workers 0 --num-gpus 0 --env-name rooms --reward-mode coverage --max-steps 400
```

GPU run:

```bash
python Explore_PPO_agent_training.py --iterations 500 --num-workers 0 --num-gpus 1 --env-name rooms --reward-mode coverage --max-steps 400
```

Checkpoints are written to:

```text
tmp/ppo_rooms/
```

The best checkpoint is saved at:

```text
tmp/ppo_rooms/checkpoint_best
```

## Test a Trained Policy

Visual rollout:

```bash
python explore_agent_rollout.py --checkpoint tmp/ppo_rooms/checkpoint_best --env-name rooms --reward-mode coverage --max-steps 400 --gui
```

Terminal-only rollout check:

```bash
python explore_agent_rollout.py --checkpoint tmp/ppo_rooms/checkpoint_best --env-name rooms --reward-mode coverage --max-steps 400 --steps 400 --sleep 0 --no-gui
```

The rollout prints the cumulative reward, checkpoint coverage, checkpoint reward maximum, and accumulated shaping penalties.
In the Pygame view, walls are black, unvisited checkpoints are red, and visited checkpoints turn green. Yellow rays show the robot's distance sensors. Rays stop at the nearest visible unvisited checkpoint only when no wall blocks the line of sight, so the visual sensor overlay does not show checkpoints through walls. The GUI includes a legend for the map, sensor rays, ray hits, and motion overlays. Live labels near the robot show whether the policy is accelerating, braking, or turning; green/blue arrows pulse in the commanded acceleration or braking direction, orange arcs pulse for turn commands, and the dark arrow shows the actual velocity direction. The simulator renders the full environment internally and displays it in a smaller `1080 x 675` window for laptop screens.

## Optional Baseline Task

The older lap-following task is still available as a baseline:

```bash
python Explore_PPO_agent_training.py --iterations 500 --num-workers 0 --num-gpus 0 --env-name playground --reward-mode continuous --max-steps 1000 --checkpoint-dir tmp/ppo_playground
```

This can be used to compare path following against unordered room exploration.

## TensorBoard

Ray writes training logs under the user `ray_results` folder.

Windows:

```bat
python -m tensorboard.main --logdir %USERPROFILE%\ray_results
```

Ubuntu/Linux/macOS:

```bash
python -m tensorboard.main --logdir ~/ray_results
```

Open the TensorBoard URL printed in the terminal.
